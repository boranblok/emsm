What is the **EMSM** ?
----------------------
   
The **Extendable Minecraft Server Manager** (EMSM) is a minecraft server
wrapper, that is able to handle multiple minecraft worlds and server versions.

The **EMSM** itself provides only a simple but sufficient **API** to manage the 
worlds. The rest of the work is done by the plugins. This makes the application
easy to extend and maintain.

Why should you use the **EMSM**?
--------------------------------

*  **Python powered**
         
   Small and readable code base, therefore easy to maintain.
         
*  **Open Source**

   Licensed under the MIT License.
                  
*  **Portable**
         
   Needs only Python, screen and java to run and should work on all Linux systems.
         
*  **Cron-Save**

   The EMSM makes sure, that only one instance of the application runs
   to the same time.

*  **InitD**

   Use the :mod:`initd` plugin to benefit from the *init.d* service.
               
*  **Simple Configuration**

   Only three simple configuration files with the simple *.ini* syntax.

*  **Backup ready**

   Create and manage multiple versions of your worlds with the
   :mod:`backup manager <backups>`.

*  **Multiple worlds and server**

   This application has been written to administrate and run multiple
   worlds and server versions to the same time.

*  **Guarded worlds**

   The :mod:`guard` helps you to monitor the worlds and to react
   on server issues automatically.

*  **Fast learning curve**

   Use the ``--help`` or ``--long-help`` argument if you don't know how
   to use a plugin.

*  **Online Documentation**  

   You don't come to grips with the configuration? Take a look at this
   online documentation.

*  **Easy to extend**

   Extend the EMSM with a simple plugin and benefit from Pythons great 
   standard library.
